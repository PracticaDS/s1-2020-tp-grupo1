## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository and clone it locally. Connect your local to the original “upstream” repository by adding it as a remote. 
Pull in changes from “upstream” often so that you stay up to date so that when you submit your pull request, merge conflicts will be less likely.
2. Create a branch for you to work in.
3. Test your changes! Run your changes against any existing tests if they exist and create new ones when needed. 
Whether tests exist or not, make sure your changes don’t break the existing project.
4. Contribute in the style of the project to the best of your abilities, using the same code style such as intents or comments
makes it easier for us to understand, merge and even maintain the project in the future.
5. Create a pull request clearly stating what changes you've made and their purpose. They should also reference any relevant 
issues.
6. Wait for our code review and approval.
